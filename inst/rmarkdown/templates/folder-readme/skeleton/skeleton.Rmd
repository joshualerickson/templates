### Overview    

The purpose of the folder structure will be described below. Within each of the folders there will likely be more `README.html` files describing the structure, data, etc. This is just a quick and dirty way to provide a description of how we are using these locations so others can follow.  

Thank you.

### Archive  

The archive folder contains 'fleeting' data or data that doesn't have a home. This data is likely not relevant anymore but most importantly is likely not documented. Considered the files within this folder _deprecated_. It is continuously being recycled so don't rely on any of the data in here.

### Projects  

The `Projects` folder will contain the projects that are currently being worked on or have already been worked on. The file name of the projects follows a pattern where everything before the suffix will be the project name and the suffix will be the year it was created, e.g. `some_project_2023`.
